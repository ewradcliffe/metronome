# Metronome

## Introduction.
A metronome is a device which repeats a steady sound to help musicians play in time. Typically the user can adjust the speed (aka tempo) according to their need. More advanced versions give the user control over other parameters.

The impetus for this project was my own desire for a metronome capable of playing at speeds higher than existing freely available models for use in my own musical practice. It was also an opportunity to implement many of the programming and planning skills I have learned.

# Planning

## Strategy
This project would be implemented usingog an agile methodology, and a plan was constructed accordingly. User stories were collected. Most of these were based on what I wanted in a metronome, others were based on various internet postings. Each of these issues would be addressed by adding features to the app. The design was to use mobile first design to support musicians practicing away from a PC. Wire frames were produced to visualise the layout of the app and a basic colour scheme was decided upon.




## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py` if your Python file is named `app.py`, of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

By Default, Gitpod gives you superuser security privileges. Therefore, you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
